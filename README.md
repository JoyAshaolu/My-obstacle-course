# My-obstacle-course
Course/ The robot must move forward 52.5 inches,picking up a donut obstacle in the process, then turns left. Next it moves forward 46 inches, going over a ramp avoiding the two obstacles on the side while still holding the donut still. Next the robot turns left and then moves forward 27.7 inches, pushing the donut into a dome like figure, then going back 15 inches moving around the obstable the robot ust put the donut in. Then the robot goes around 2 obstacles. When the robot has gone around those obstacles , it takes a u turn landing back at its original spot. 

Interactions with obstacles/ When my basebot encounters and obstacle it cant go over. It stops and goes around that obstacle.

Running the Python script/ To run the python script, you must connect the device with the code to your robot through cable, click on brain, press connect find your robotand connect with it. Then find te download key and click it. When the code has been transfered, click run on your robot.

What worked well& what didn't/ The code worked well because it moved in all the directions we asked it to, however, we faced the challenges of turning quick enough and finding the perfect measurements.
